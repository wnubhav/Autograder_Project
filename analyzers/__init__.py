"""Analyzer registry.

The rules JSON names an analyzer for each metric (for example "io_tests").
REGISTRY maps that name to the Python function that does the work.
Every analyzer function is called as
    analyze(source_path, first_pass, params, rules)
and returns:
    {"score": 0..1, "evidence": {...}, "feedback": "one line"}
We fill this in as we write each analyzer.
