"""Modularity analyzer: is the work split into helper functions?

lizard lists every function defined in the file. A helper (any function
except main) only counts if it is called from inside another function.
Otherwise a student could add an empty, unused function to raise the score.
We remove comments first, so a commented-out call does not count either.

counted  = main (if present) + helpers that are called
required = params["min_functions"], and at least 2 if params["expect_helpers"]
score    = counted / required (never above 1)

With the brief's rules (min_functions 2), a program with only main() scores 0.5.
