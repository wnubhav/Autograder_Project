"""Readability analyzer: ask an LLM (on Groq) to rate how readable the code is.

We send the student's code with a fixed prompt to Groq's OpenAI-compatible
chat API (https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions) and ask for JSON like
    {"score": 7, "reasons": ["clear names", "no comments"]}
score = that number / 10.

The API key is read from the GROQ_API_KEY environment variable. It is never
stored in a file in the repo, so it cannot be committed by mistake.

Reproducible grades:
  - temperature 0 and a fixed seed (both from the rules) make the model
    give the same answer to the same question as far as Groq allows;
  - every answer is also saved in cache/llm/<hash>.json, where the hash is
    made from the code, the prompt, the model, the temperature and the seed.
    On a rerun we read the saved answer instead of asking again, so the
    score cannot change even if the model would answer slightly differently.
    cache/llm/ is committed, so anyone who clones the repo gets the same
    readability scores for the sample submissions without needing a key.

If an answer is not in the cache and there is no key, or Groq refuses the
request, we stop the whole grading run with a message that says how to fix it.
Carrying on would give readability 0 and a grade that is wrong without anyone
noticing.
