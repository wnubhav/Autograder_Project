"""First pass: quick checks before the real analyzers run.

1. Regex checks on the source: does it have main, scanf, printf, return?
2. Compile with plain gcc (no -Werror). This binary is what every run-based
   analyzer uses. The syntax analyzer does its own, stricter compile, so
   warnings only lower the syntax score and never block the other analyzers.
3. Smoke run: run the binary once on the sample input inside the sandbox.

If the program does not compile, or the smoke run times out (we then set
suspected_infinite_loop), can_run is False and the coordinator should run
only the source-based analyzers (syntax, structure, modularity, readability,
originality). A crash does not set can_run to False: the other analyzers
still run, and io_tests and sanitizer_run will show what went wrong.

Try it by hand:
    python3 first_pass.py rules/add.json submissions/add/*.c
